## üíª Optional: Communicate with PC (PuTTY)

To test communication, you can use PuTTY on a Windows PC:

### **Step 1: Identify COM Port**

1. Open **Device Manager**.
2. Find your USB-UART adapter under `Ports (COM & LPT)`.

In this example, the port is `COM9`.

### **Step 2: Configure PuTTY**

1. Open PuTTY.
2. Choose **Serial** as the connection type.
3. Set the serial line to match your port (e.g., `COM9`).
4. Set the speed to `115200` (must match your Android app settings).
